```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#devtools::install("hmumme/survivalHelp") # uncomment if you have not installed survivalHelp
library(survivalHelp)
load("~/GitHub/survivalHelp/demo/data/mpalData.RData") # load demo data
```

The file mpalData.RData contains the necessary objects to run survival analysis on the MPAL samples from the TARGET-ALL-P3 (ALAL) datasets. It includes the bulkRNA-seq expression matrices for both the B/Myeloid and T/Myeloid MPAL samples, the ensmbl id matrices, the ensmbl to gene symbol reference data frame, and the survival data for both subsets. 

```{r ls()}
ls()
```

First, we will show how to obtain survival plots for a single gene's expression in B/Myeloid MPAL samples.

```{r single gene B/M}

```
